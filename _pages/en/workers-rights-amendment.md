### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">What is the Workers’ Rights Amendment (WRA)?</span>

The WRA states “Employees shall have the **fundamental right to organize** and to **bargain collectively** through representatives of their own choosing for the purpose of **negotiating wages, hours, and working conditions, and to protect their economic welfare and safety at work**. No law shall be passed that interferes with, negates, or diminishes the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively over their wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment and work place safety, including any law or ordinance that prohibits the execution or application of agreements between employers and labor organizations that represent employees requiring membership in an organization as a condition of employment.” If the amendment gets enough votes on November 8th, this amendment will be added to the Illinois State Constitution.

### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Why is the WRA important?</span>

It is important to vote **YES** for the WRA because it will:

- **Help build an economy that works for every Illinoisan** by guaranteeing workers’ rights to organize and negotiate for pay raises, lifting worker pay to help deal with rising costs, and helping create good-paying jobs available to all workers
- **Protect all Illinoisans, on the job and off** by ensuring workers can speak out about dangerous situations that put all Illinoisans at risk without fear of retaliation from their employer
- **Strengthen our communities by protecting first responders like nurses, firefighters, and EMTs,** giving the people who put their lives on the line to protect us the training and safety equipment they need to get home safely each day

### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Interested in organizing your workplace?</span>

If you’re feeling frustrated at work, and thinking about quitting, you’re not alone. Workers everywhere are saying “enough” and mobilizing collectively to resign from their jobs in protest after decades of stagnant wages, unpredictable schedules, and lack of health care or paid sick leave. By organizing your workplace, you can win real, lasting improvements that allow you and your co-workers to flourish in your jobs. After all, it’s your labor and cooperation that keeps the business running day after day.

The [Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee ](https://workerorganizing.org/)(EWOC) is a project of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) to build a distributed, grassroots organizing program to support workers organizing at the workplace. We are organizing workers to get the hazard pay and adequate protections they deserve and fight for dignity, respect, and racial equality.

[Contact us](https://workerorganizing.org/support/) to get connected with a workplace organizer to get you the support you need.

### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Are you a union member or interested in the labor movement?</span>

Check out Chicago DSA’s [calendar ](/events)for upcoming meetings of our Labor branch. Our labor branch is involved in a variety of struggles, including implementing the [rank-and-file strategy](https://rfs.dsausa.org), supporting unionization efforts, and standing in solidarity with workers on strike. While much of the branch is made up of rank-and-file union members, shop-floor leaders, and union staffers, the Labor Branch aims to be a political home for anyone in CDSA who wants to get more involved in the labor movement, as part of the struggle for an anti-racist, anti-capitalist future.
