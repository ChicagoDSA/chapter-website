Campaigns are priority causes that CDSA has voted as a chapter to take on to focus our resources. In considering whether to take on a campaign, we consider whether the campaign will build working class power, raise class consciousness, give opportunities for political education, and whether we think it is a winnable fight. Campaign organizing includes planning and strategy meetings, canvassing, calling our neighbors, planning actions, and organizing our communities and workplaces. CDSA's working groups support campaign work based on specific needs.
