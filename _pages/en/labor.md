Chicago DSA's Labor Branch is dedicated to building a militant, rank-and-file-led labor movement. As socialists, we know that withholding our labor is the greatest weapon we have to challenge the bosses, disrupt capital, and bargain for the common good of the working class, and our mission at the Labor Branch is to encourage workplace combativity and build fighting unions from the bottom-up. 

The Branch was born out of an effort to coalesce the work our members were doing in unions and workplaces across Chicago and develop a shared strategy. While much of the branch is made up of rank-and-file union members, shop-floor leaders, and union staffers, the Labor Branch aims to be a political home for anyone in CDSA who wants to get more involved in the labor movement, as part of the struggle for an anti-racist, anti-capitalist future. 

## Our work

The Labor Branch is involved in a variety of struggles, including implementing the rank-and-file strategy, supporting unionization efforts, and standing in solidarity with workers on strike. Along with our general body, the branch is led by an elected Steering Committee and broken up into two subcommittees: the Rank and File Committee and the Strike and Solidarity Committee. 
 
- The **Rank and File Committee** is a space for unionized workers and workers attempting to unionize to strategize, talk shop, and educate themselves on the ins-and-outs of workplace organizing. It's work helps support CDSA members attempting to implement the rank-and-file strategy in their workplace or union. 
 
- The **Strike and Solidarity Committee** coordinates the Branch's efforts supporting workers on strike or engaged in other fights. Its work includes doing strike support and picket captaining, media campaigns, and raising strike funds. Text SOLIDARITY to 77222 to receive updates about strike support.

We meet every second Tuesday of the month. If you want to learn more, have questions or proposals for the branch, or want to get on our email list and Slack channel, contact [labor@chicagodsa.org](mailto:labor@chicagodsa.org).
