Working groups are categorized by different expertises that support the functions of the chapter and its priority campaigns. All members are encouraged to join a working group, and we seek participation from all skills, trades and backgrounds. The work of these groups promote strategies and advance tactics that forward a working-class-centered politics of humanity and solidarity, effect positive change in Chicago's neighborhoods, and build relationships with other organizations with similar goals.
