Working groups are categorized by different expertises that support the functions of the chapter and its priority campaigns. All members are encouraged to join a working group, and we seek participation from all skills, trades and backgrounds. The work of these groups promote strategies and advance tactics that forward a working-class-centered politics of humanity and solidarity, effect positive change in Chicago's neighborhoods, and build relationships with other organizations with similar goals. 

Learn how to get involved in the working groups below and check out the events page to join an upcoming meeting.
