## Overview

Gathering as a membership, CDSA's highest decision-making body, we will be engaging in important debate and votes about our policies and priorities. We will also vote on the [consent agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14SU40fo70KR9Dfpco67y9zKK__Iw55icYR6LT4Vfn7w/edit?ts=60c8c0a6), at which time the General Membership may take any action (ratify, amend, repeal) regarding votes taken by the Executive Committee since the General Chapter Meeting (GCM) in April. These can be found in the #ec-votes channel on the CDSA Slack.

The [agenda](#agenda) is currently being developed and will include the final Towards a Socialist Chicago (TaSC) priorities document as well as the implementation plan from the Transparency and Accountability Ad Hoc Committee. We invite you to stay up to date on TaSC key information by reviewing the TaSC toolkit [here](http://bit.ly/TaSCToolkit).

<hr>

## Pre-Convention Technology Rules and Procedures

These rules and procedures were adopted at our June 12th EC meeting.

**Agenda Accomodations for Virtual Sign in & Tech Support**

The meeting will begin at 11:30am with 30 min for virtual sign in and tech support for members logging into the voting tool. However, in order to account for additional sign in time that may be needed due to members signing in right at noon, and time needed to reach quorum for voting, the first item on the agenda will be the political education portion of the meeting.

**Action Network Meeting Registration**

Attendees must [register](https://actionnetwork.org/events/chicago-dsa-june-chapter-convention-registration) on Action Network form to attend the meeting. Only confirmed members will receive the link to participate in the votes. If a member is not in good standing, they need to [update their membership](http://dsausa.org/join) prior to the meeting in order to vote and count toward quorum, though non-members can observe.

**Proposal Question & Answer Procedure**

Since most questions are disallowed by Robert’s Rules during the meeting itself, members will be able to submit questions for bylaws amendment and proposal authors in advance of the meeting, using the same timeline as the Amendment Procedure.

Questions must be submitted using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEAprxFTGSK3lWQOidCFUS9PLmvlQW-jRSYizlwH3UPlpkDw/viewform?usp=sf_link) by end of day Wednesday June 23rd, and will be sent to the appropriate proposal author(s) by email. Responses from authors will be compiled and circulated to the membership within 24 hours of the chapter meeting. If for any reason the author is unable to respond to question(s) within the specified timeframe, they may choose to address those questions in their motivation for their proposal during the meeting.

**Zoom Meeting – All registrants**

This Zoom meeting will require a password. You will be sent the password upon registering in the action network and again upon registering with the Zoom link.
Zoom Features
Chat is disabled
Microphones muted
Closed Captioning is available
Translation line available if any members indicate such need in their registration

**Voting tool - Members in good standing only**

[See tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2uKo07zvnQ). At the beginning of the meeting, members will receive a link to log into that will be used for motions, debate, and votes during business-related portions of the meeting.

We will use this tool for the following:

1. Uploading all the motions in the agenda ahead of time
2. Adding motions/questions that we need to add throughout the meeting
3. Stack  
   a. Pro  
   b. Against  
   c. Call the Question  
   d. Second  
   e. Point of Order  
   f. Point of Information  
   g. Other (This is being added specifically for our mtg)

All motions and amendments will be uploaded ahead of time into the voting tool. Any substantive motions made throughout the meeting will be added in real time.

**Amendment Procedure and Timeline**

Due to this meeting being virtual, and due to the size of the meeting, members must submit amendments to the business-related items on the agenda prior to the meeting. Amendments to all proposals on the agenda will be due by end of day Wednesday June 23rd. Amendments will be posted on the agenda within 24 hours of the chapter mtg. Amendments must be substantive. Stylistic amendments and amendments to whereas clauses or proposal rationale will be deprioritized for the sake of time.

Members can submit amendments using [this form](https://forms.gle/etStd15DNv5R2L8z9).

No more than two amendments will be considered per proposal, except in the case of the Towards a Socialist Chicago Proposal, which may receive more if time allows. If there are more than two amendments per proposal, then the chairs (or their designees) will attempt to consolidate those amendments into 3 or less.

<hr>

## Convention Special Meeting Rules (not yet adopted)

These rules must be voted on and adopted at the top of the meeting. Adopting these rules helps keep the meeting efficient while also allowing for as much debate as possible on our business items.

1. Any item stripped from the consent agenda shall receive ten minutes for debate with any member being limited to one minute to speak from the floor.
2. Amendments to the proposals from the floor will not be accepted.
3. Each proposal will be motivated by one speaker who will have 4 minutes to motivate their proposal.
4. All speakers during debate will have 2 min to speak.
5. When votes are called, they will be open on the voting tool for 60 seconds.

**Understanding the Consent Agenda**

The general membership is the largest and most powerful governing body in our chapter. Therefore the general membership has the right to review all the votes taken by the EC since our last general membership meeting. The general membership must either vote to approve the entire consent agenda, or they can motion and vote to strip an item from the consent agenda to be debated and either approved or revoked. Our special rules that we will vote on will allow ten minutes for debate for an item stripped from the consent agenda.

## What you need to know about Robert's Rules

We use Robert’s Rules of Order to conduct all our business meetings. It is important for all members of CDSA to familiarize ourselves with Robert’s Rules to make sure the meetings run smoothly. It’s also important for members to be aware of what rights they have in a meeting. Robert’s Rules are intended to make debate more transparent and accessible. If you’re not sure what is going on or don’t know how to do something procedural, get on stack with a “point of information.” The chair will recognize you and answer your question before continuing with debate.

Here are some resources to review to brush up on essential robert's rules motions:
