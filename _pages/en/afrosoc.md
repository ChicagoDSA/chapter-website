Chicago Afrosocialists + Socialists of Color Caucus (Chicago AfroSOC) advocates for and builds power with Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) and our communities. We are a BIPOC-led, BIPOC-only organization. We aim to continue the legacy of the Black socialist and abolitionist traditions that are so rich and deeply-embedded in Chicago history, as well as the radical traditions of other oppressed minorities.

We bring a socialist politic to our work through education, direct action, and building coalitions with other BIPOC-led organizations. We pursue this work to abolish white supremacy and capitalism, build a multiracial working-class base, and fight for our collective liberation.

## Our work

The work of AfroSOC members prioritizes bringing communities at the margins to the center. This takes many shapes and adapts to the circumstances facing BIPOC individuals in Chicago. Currently, AfroSOC has two commitees: Mutual Aid and Political Education.

- Members of the **Mutual Aid Committee** bring together aid events where members and community volunteers distribute items and engage neighbors in CDSA campaign efforts. Members aim to make event self-sustaining by encouraging those receiving aid to organize future events and organize each other into communities of care.
