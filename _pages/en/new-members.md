## Attend a _What is CDSA?_ orientation

Once a month, Chicago DSA hosts orientations for those interested in learning about DSA, for newly joined members, as well as existing members who are looking for ways to reconnect with the chapter. Chapter members will discuss:

- The basics of democratic socialism
- DSA's national and local structures
- Ways to get involved

Representatives from our [campaigns](campaigns) and [working groups](working-groups) will present their work, invite folks to join, and collect names.
