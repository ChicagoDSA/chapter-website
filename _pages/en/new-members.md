## Attend a _What is CDSA?_ orientation

Once a month, Chicago DSA hosts orientations for those interested in learning about DSA, for newly joined members, as well as existing members who are looking for ways to reconnect with the chapter. Chapter members will discuss:

- The basics of democratic socialism
- DSA's national and local structures
- Ways to get involved

Representatives from our [campaigns](campaigns) and [working groups](working-groups) will present their work, invite folks to join, and collect names.

#### Join the Rose Buddy mentorship program

At the end of each _What is CDSA?_ orientation, weâ€™ll invite you to join the Rose Buddy program, our mentorship program that pairs new and experienced CDSA members to help you connect with the chapter. Over a three-month period, a Chicago DSA mentor will:

- Schedule check-ins
- Answer your questions
- Connect you with activities and comrades
