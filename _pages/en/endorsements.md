**Chicago DSA democratically decides on campaigns we endorse in election cycles.**

Endorsed candidates can expect material support in gathering petition signatures, canvassing and phone banking voters, as well as monetary contributions from members and the chapter’s PAC.

**Please reach out to the Electoral Working Group at [electoral@chicagodsa.org](mailto:electoral@chicagodsa.org) if you have any questions about endorsements.**

In general, Chicago DSA follows the below process for considering endorsements:

1. Candidates seeking endorsement must fill out and return a candidate questionnaire to the Electoral Working Group by a set deadline. This deadline is set by the Electoral Working Group and depends on the election schedules, and whether endorsements are requested in time for petition season (‘pre-petition’ endorsement) or later on, closer to election day (‘post-petition’ endorsement). The questionnaire can be requested by emailing the Chicago DSA Electoral Working Group at [electoral@chicagodsa.org](mailto:electoral@chicagodsa.org).
2. The Electoral Working Group reviews candidate questionnaires and then votes on whether to bring each candidate in for an interview.
3. The Electoral Working Group then votes on whether to advance interviewed candidates to the general membership for a vote on endorsement. Candidates not advanced by the Electoral Working Group may also be advanced by a vote of the Executive Committee of Chicago DSA.
4. Finally, the entire chapter votes on endorsement, and candidates are notified of the result.

The endorsement process is completed within 1-2 months of each endorsement period’s deadline.
