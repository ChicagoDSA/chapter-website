**Chicago DSA is currently accepting endorsement requests for the 2023 election cycle. Candidates seeking pre-petition endorsement must return their questionnaires by July 3rd, 2021 at 11:59PM CST.** Candidates seeking post-petition endorsements must return their questionnaires by November 27th at 11:59pm CST.

Candidates seeking endorsement must fill out and return a candidate questionnaire to the Electoral Working Group by a set deadline depending on their race and whether they are requesting an endorsement in time for petition season (‘pre-petition’ endorsement) or later on closer to election day (‘post-petition’ endorsement). The questionnaire can be requested by emailing the Chicago DSA Electoral Working Group at [electoral@chicagodsa.org](mailto:electoral@chicagodsa.org).

The Electoral Working Group reviews candidate questionnaires and then votes on whether to bring each candidate in for an interview. The Electoral Working Group then votes on whether to advance interviewed candidates to the general membership for a vote on endorsement. Candidates not advanced by the Electoral Working Group may also be advanced by a vote of the Executive Committee of Chicago DSA.

Endorsements will be finalized within 1-2 months of each endorsement period’s deadline for candidate submissions.

Please reach out to the Electoral Working Group with any questions. A detailed timeline for 2022 and 2023 endorsements can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18l4NFaDyGNl0AA3gii3Cul7qwdC2JRXRdv6UWChgA2o/edit?usp=sharing).
