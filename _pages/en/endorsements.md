#### What campaigns will Chicago DSA consider endorsing? 
Chicago DSA will consider endorsing candidates whose district partially or completely falls within Cook County.  Our members will also consider endorsing ballot measures that would be effective within Cook County.

#### Why apply for a Chicago DSA endorsement?
Democratic Socialists have helped elect alderpeople, local school council members, and Cook County Commissioners. Endorsed candidates can expect material support in gathering petition signatures, canvassing and phone banking voters, as well as monetary contributions from members and the chapter’s PAC.  If you believe that ALL people should be democratically deciding how to best meet human needs (not just the rich and powerful), we would like to hear from you!  Please reach out to the Electoral Working Group for an endorsement application at <electoral@chicagodsa.org>.

#### How does our endorsement process work?
Chicago DSA democratically decides on campaigns we endorse in election cycles. Because of this, the endorsement process is completed 1-2 months after the endorsement application deadline.  In general, Chicago DSA follows the below process for considering endorsements:

1. Candidates seeking endorsement must fill out and return a candidate questionnaire to the Electoral Working Group by a set deadline. This deadline is set by the Electoral Working Group and depends on the election schedules, and whether endorsements are requested in time for petition season (‘pre-petition’ endorsement) or later on, closer to election day (‘post-petition’ endorsement). The questionnaire can be requested by emailing the Chicago DSA Electoral Working Group at <electoral@chicagodsa.org>.

2. The Electoral Working Group reviews candidate questionnaires and then votes on whether to bring each candidate in for an interview. 

3. The Electoral Working Group then votes on whether to advance interviewed candidates to the general membership for a vote on endorsement. Candidates not advanced by the Electoral Working Group may also be advanced by a vote of the Executive Committee of Chicago DSA.

4. Finally, the entire chapter votes on endorsement, and candidates are notified of the result.
