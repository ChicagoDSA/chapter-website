## Pay dues

When you pay national dues, you're automatically a member of Chicago DSA. You can work on campaigns, run for our elected offices, and vote on chapter issues. Join as a *Movement Builder* and 20% of your dues will be shared directly with Chicago DSA.

{% include comp-button.html text="Join national DSA" link="https://www.dsausa.org/join" %}

*[Dues waivers](https://dsausa.org/dueswaiver) are available.*

## We'll add you to our list

Every Monday, we receive a list of new members. We use this to:

- Add folks to our Sunday newsletter, *This Week in CDSA*
- Send time-sensitive text messages and emails
- Verify access to our Slack workspace

#### A special note

22% of our funding comes from members who donate a little extra, and allies that are down with the cause. If you can afford it, set up a recurring or one-time donation. 100% of all donations benefit Chicago DSA campaigns and programs.
