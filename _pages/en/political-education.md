Things suck under capitalism. Your rent keeps rising, your landlord’s an asshole, it’s hard to find a job, and, when you do finally get one, your boss works you long hours for little pay, and there’s no union to help. You’re in debt, you can’t afford any time off, which makes you anxious and stressed, so you get a psychiatrist, but your health insurance (if you’re lucky enough to have it) charges you exorbitant out-of-pocket fees. Meanwhile, police keep shooting unarmed Black people, there’s a raging pandemic killing millions, the planet is burning up, and there are 60 million Americans living in poverty. Yet rich people keep getting richer, Amazon doesn’t pay any taxes, the CEO of Starbucks gets paid 700 times more than a barista that works for him, and the top 50 richest Americans have more wealth than the bottom 50 percent combined.

Throughout our daily lives, capitalist exploitation robs us, the working class, of the value that we produce and confines us to the prison of necessity. We work hard, we literally create all of society’s wealth, yet the bosses and owners keep the profits and reap the rewards of our labor, while tossing us back scraps and poverty wages. This exploitation alienates us from each other, society, nature, and even ourselves. Meanwhile, capitalism’s ideological apparatus bombards us with propaganda that clouds, distorts, and conceals reality – obscuring who is responsible for this unjust state of affairs while telling us that it’s our own fault if we didn’t pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and get rich. It confuses and divides us, eroding solidarity and discouraging collective action.

This is where political education comes in. Political education is an essential weapon in our fight for a better world because it helps expose the grim capitalist reality for what it really is – a system where the few exploit the many, where the lucky capitalists at the top engorge themselves with luxuries while everyone else toils in relative misery below. It helps illuminate the inner workings of capitalism and disentangle its many contradictions – allowing us to connect the dots between our own personal struggles and the broader socioeconomic system that oppresses us all. It channels our righteous yet isolated fury into a collective force capable of toppling the system and ushering in a new socialist alternative.

By rooting us in the rich history of the socialist movement, political education provides a foundation of shared concepts and questions that can inform our decisions and debates. And it sets the horizon for our struggle beyond the tasks immediately in front of us; it helps us develop a long-term strategy to get from where we are now (suffering under capitalism) to where we want to be (living in a beautiful socialist world). We firmly believe that political education is what makes socialists for life.

Equally important, political education is essential to developing a robust, democratic political culture in our organization – a culture our movement needs to thrive. Our political education spaces are a place for CDSA members to learn how to participate in comradely discussion and debate and to develop a shared analysis of our historical moment and the conditions in which we organize. It builds a sense of community and camaraderie – forging the social bonds necessary to withstand the long trials ahead. So much of our organizing work is urgent and operates on a timescale of weeks or months, but through a commitment to political education, we can insist on space to slow down and think together in a way that supports our capacity to act collectively. We take seriously the proposition that “every cook can govern” and believe that political education has the potential to build the capacity of the working class to govern ourselves.

If these are the stakes of our work, our philosophy of and approach to political education also has important implications. Discussion is central to our political education practice. We believe it is not enough to present the “right” ideas to people; members should be able to articulate ideas in their own words and with a grounding in their own experience. We must get comfortable talking about our ideas to each other and to the millions of working class people we need to bring into our movement. In fact, one of the highlights of our political education program is the small-group facilitation team. These comrades are learning alongside our participants. Their role is to help everyone participate in the discussion and to enforce our community agreements, especially the feminist process discussion guidelines. At the same time, we understand that there is tremendous value in expertise and experience, so we occasionally feature “from-the-front” style presentations and panels as part of our program. We consider it a best practice, however, to include ample time for discussion in these types of events. As Paulo Freire said, “If the structure does not permit dialogue, the structure must be changed.”

Another element of our political education philosophy is our orientation to texts and socialist theory. We view texts not as dogma, but as participants in our discussion, and we aim to emphasize the way in which texts themselves are an intervention in previous debates. Reading theory gives us important conceptual tools to step outside of our immediate experience, interrogate the world around us, and evaluate our capacity to act within it. Reading history helps us connect to socialist struggles across time and space.

In our political education programs, in particular Socialist Night School and Red Ed, we emphasize the Marxist tradition. DSA is a fundamentally anti-capitalist organization that aims to be a political home for the working class. We believe that Marxism represents a rich tradition of anti-capitalist, working class political writing, one which has galvanized millions of people around the world to fight for their own liberation. We are also aware that there are many tendencies within Marxism, from anti-imperialism, to Marxist feminisms, to Black liberation Marxisms, to Marxisms of indigenous liberation. The historical materialist method articulated by Marx and developed by hundreds of others remains an important analytical tool for us to ask meaningful questions about how capitalism works and what it will take to overcome it. Historically and into the present day, this tradition has been the language of the left globally, and it is our responsibility to ensure our members are familiar with it – even if they come to different conclusions. We believe it is possible to put forward a clear political orientation without treating it as a line. Pedagogically, we see substantial value in putting forward a clear position for members to respond to. When matched with a culture that encourages comradely debate, this approach helps our members develop their own positions, and it’s why discussion and openness are so important to our philosophy of political education. Most of all, we trust in the ability, desire, and capacity of working class people to understand capitalism, develop their politics, engage in debate, and strategize for change.

Capitalism sucks, but education is the first step toward liberation. If you’d like to learn more, together, please join us at one of our many events!
