Launched in 2018, Socialist Night School (SNS) is our committee’s flagship program and also its longest running. While it’s not always at night and it isn’t like your typical school, it provides a regular opportunity for our membership and the general public to discuss and learn about socialism. We’ve tackled a variety of highly relevant topics from a socialist perspective – including Black liberation, gentrification, social reproduction, reform vs. revolution, and abolition – while also delving into socialist theory, class analysis, history, politics, economics, and much more.

Prior to each class, we distribute brief readings (which may include articles, book excerpts, etc.) to help ground our discussions. Each class begins with a short introduction, followed by alternating small- and large-group discussions. We, however, prioritize the small-group discussions, which we see as a critical component in facilitating mutually-beneficial dialogue and a comradely exchange of ideas. Compared to “from-the-front” lecture style events, we believe these small group discussions provide an ideal atmosphere for thinking through socialist ideas together. C-DSA is a broad-tent organization, so we don’t adhere to a single strain of socialist thinking, but we do tend to focus on Marxist insights.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, all classes have been held virtually via Zoom, and about 20 to 60 people attend each class. Classes are held roughly every two weeks and are organized into “semesters”, with about 5 or 6 classes per semester. You don’t need to come to all classes in a semester – you can choose whichever ones you’d like to attend.

Thanks to the hard work of so many members, SNS is now in its seventh semester. As a result, we have developed quite an extensive collection of readings and questions. Please peruse these previous materials at your leisure, and – more importantly – we’d love to see you at the next class!
