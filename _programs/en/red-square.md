Red Square is a monthly program where CDSA members can learn about the political questions facing socialists and other radicals and progressives. It is a productive, comradely venue for discussion and debate that can both inform members and improve our collective analysis. The ambition is to create an intentional space engaging the perennial “what is to be done?” question on a range of topics. So far, we have completed sessions covering topics like “How and where do we build power as socialists?”, “Socialists and Elections”, and “How Should Socialists Respond to the Rise of the Far Right?” Sessions begin with a brief introduction to the topic followed by facilitated small- and large-group discussions.

No homework or preparation required – just join us on Zoom and get ready for some fruitful conversations!
