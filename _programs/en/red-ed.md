Originating as a Capital reading group, Red Ed has evolved into a Marxist study group that conducts deep dives into socialist theory on pertinent topics. The new format consists of a number of lengthy series each covering discrete topics such as “The Economics of Urban Real Estate” and “Race and Capitalism.” The group meets monthly, with each meeting discussing around 100 pages of reading.

Red Ed is by design a space that is connected to campaigns and work happening throughout the chapter, but in a non-instrumental and indirect way. The ambition is to use the infrastructure of the PEP committee to create a space for reflection on the mechanics of capital, lessons of past struggle, and socialist strategy that is one step removed from the urgency of day-to-day activism. Each series will encourage participation from PEP committee members and counterparts from relevant campaign and working groups in the chapter.
