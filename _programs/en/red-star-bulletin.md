Red Star Bulletin (RSB) is a standing program focused on policy and centered on a regular newsletter covering local politics, state politics, Chicago City Council proceedings, and other policy-related news items. The newsletter has published dozens of issues, generally covering two to three different subjects. The editorial mission focuses on putting forward a socialist analysis of current events. The newsletter reaches beyond our chapter and is widely read by CDSA-adjacent politicos and local media figures.

In addition to the newsletter, RSB has published special editions providing regular updates and analysis on the 2019 CTU strike, the 2021 SEIU Local 73 strike, and produced Red Star Live in collaboration with the Communications Committee â€“ providing the same high-quality analysis of the newsletter in video form. In the long term, RSB is helping the committee build the knowledge, research capacities, and infrastructure for a CDSA policy-developing apparatus.
