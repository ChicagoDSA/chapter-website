Red Review is a monthly program that fulfills the longstanding interest for more cultural events and programming. Rather than engaging with “left culture”, the program discusses pop culture, primarily focusing on movies and television. Participants watch on their own time and come to Red Review meetings to discuss. Discussion concentrates less on the relative political merits of a work and more on what insights about capitalism and class struggle we can develop through critical engagement with cultural productions – thereby honing participants’ analytical capacities in a light-hearted and accessible environment. Past events include discussion of Spike Lee’s “Inside Man” (heist movies and capital), “You’ve Got Mail” (gentrification and the image of the petit-bourgeois), and “Star Trek” (science fiction and post-capitalist imaginaries).

If you like discussing movies, TV, and anything pop culture, but wish there was a place where you could talk about them from a socialist perspective, this is the group for you!
