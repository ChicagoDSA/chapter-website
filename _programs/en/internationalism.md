The newfound Internationalism Standing Program focuses on a solidarity without borders, inviting comrades from all over the world to stand and organize with a focus on anti-imperialist politics. The program consists of a series of political education events, which include readings, viewings, and panel discussions from experts teaching us about struggles across the world and how we can learn and practice together. If global capital operates across borders, we have to be able to organize across borders as well. After all, socialism can’t exist in one country alone if it is to last – we need a truly internationalist socialist revolution to break the chains of the working class once and for all. There’s a reason The Communist Manifesto concludes with, “Workers of the world, unite!”
