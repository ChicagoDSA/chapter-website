Red Reading Circle (RRC) is our democratically-run and nonhierarchical reading group. We go through whole books together, a few chapters at a time, to have long-form engagement and community building with CDSA members and non-member socialists alike. As we don’t have any leaders, we have rotating roles and responsibilities that we sign up for on a week-by-week basis.

So far, RRC has covered texts such as “In Defense of Looting: A Riotous History of Uncivil Action” by Vicky Osterweil, Our History is Our Future by Nick Estes, War Against All Puerto Ricans by Nelson Denis, and A Theology of Liberation by Gustavo Gutiérrez, among others.

We meet every Sunday at 6:00PM CT and welcome comrades from all of DSA and those who are not DSA members – join us at the next one!
