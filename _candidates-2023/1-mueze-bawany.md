Mueze Bawany is a public school teacher and community leader running for alderman in Chicago’s 50th Ward. When he was three years old, Mueze’s family took refuge in America from Karachi, Pakistan, and found themselves embraced by the community of West Ridge.
<br>
<br>
Mueze grew up experiencing the unique struggles, beauty, and diversity of West Ridge–but has only known machine leadership that neglects the needs of the most vulnerable. A proud graduate of Clinton Elementary, Mueze’s dedication to working class struggles has led him to oppose school closures, join environmental justice fights, and support community safety, rent control, immigrant rights, and rideshare workers’ rights. These are the issues that impact us all, but especially in the 50th Ward–where poverty rates among residents under the age of 17 is 23.3%.
<br>
<br>
Mueze will prioritize economic justice, responsive governance, housing security, fully-funded schools, and non-violent solutions to public safety issues. His campaign seeks to foster deeper community relationships between the 30+ ethnic groups that compose the ward and include everyone in ward decisions to improve every resident’s quality of life.
