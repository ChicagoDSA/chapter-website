Ambria Taylor is a teacher, proud CTU member, longtime Bridgeport resident, and democratic socialist running to represent Chicago’s 11th Ward, which includes Armour Square, Bridgeport, Canaryville, Chinatown, and McKinley Park. The 11th Ward is the historic home of the Daley political machine. Our current alderman, Nicole Lee, was appointed by Mayor Lightfoot after our previous alderman, Patrick Daley Thompson, was convicted of felony tax fraud and sentenced to four months jail time. Nicole Lee is the daughter of Gene Lee, who served as deputy chief of staff to Mayor Richard M. Daley and was convicted of felony embezzlement and tax fraud for stealing from Chinatown charities.

At 17, Ambria moved from rural Illinois to Chicago and lived in a studio apartment with her brother and mother. Ambria has watched loved ones be denied healthcare, felt her dignity shrink in face of judgment for relying on food banks, and worked odd jobs at late hours in high school to help her family survive. Ambria went from being a Chicago Public Schools high school drop out to obtaining a masters degree in teaching from the University of Chicago. Her life experiences have taught her to be tenacious, tough, and resourceful, and led her to socialist organizing. Ambria has been a member of Chicago DSA for many years, helping start the public education working group which later folded into the Labor Branch, running our first Local School Council elections in 2018, serving our Electoral Working Group on the steering committee, and representing our chapter at both the 2019 and 2021 National DSA conventions.

Ambria believes all people deserve dignified working and living conditions, in making tangible improvements to public schools, in implementing community solutions to public safety, protecting our health by standing up to polluters, and in expanding affordable housing. Ambria is a strong advocate for our public infrastructure and transportation that benefits everyone. Our current politicians consistently fail to provide everyday people with what we need and deserve. Ambria’s public service over the past decade shows her motivation is to create a government that benefits the people and to build people power to make society better for us all. Ambria will never make deals behind your back, and she’s ready to fight for you on Chicago City Council. Help us win the world, city, and ward we deserve by voting for Ambria Taylor for 11th Ward Alderman on Tuesday, February 28th.
