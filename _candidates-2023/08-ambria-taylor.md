Ambria is a long-time resident of her ward, teacher, and has been an active CDSA member since 2017. A class-struggle campaign is one that throws the differences between socialist politics and the politics of the Democratic Party into clear relief for all to see. The gap is stark; with Ambria on the left, and no one in the middle - in a crowded field in the heart of the Chicago Democratic Machine. And the word on the street is that the 11th ward is ready to move forward.
