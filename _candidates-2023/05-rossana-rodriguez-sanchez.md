Alderwoman Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez has delivered improvements to her ward's neighborhood schools, brought affordable housing to the ward, and championed innovative programs for public health and safety.

In her first four years, Rossana has increased ward democracy by giving neighbors a vote in important decisions in the ward and has helped transform City Hall by ensuring it is no longer a rubber stamp for the mayor. She worked to codify Chicago as a sanctuary city for immigrants and recently led legislation to codify abortion and transgender rights. Currently, Rossana is championing Treatment Not Trauma in order to reopen closed mental health clinics and create a crisis response system that sends mental health professionals to respond to mental health crises. In her next term, Rossana will continue to fight to make Chicago a city that provides for the many, not the few.
