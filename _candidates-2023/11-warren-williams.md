Warren Williams is a lifelong Chicagoan who has called the Northwest Side home for years. He is the proud son of union parents who taught him the power of a unified working class. He was diagnosed with epilepsy in his early 20s, a condition that has affected his ability to drive and led him to rely heavily on the CTA and cycling to get around the city, like many Chicagoans.
<br>
<br>
At the start of 2020, Warren founded 30th United, an Independent Political Organizations. With 30th United, he has organized with the community on zoning and new development issues against predatory developers, cleaning up busy streets throughout the ward, ensuring the most vulnerable communities have access to COVID-19 vaccinations, supporting community leaders in local elections, and canvassing regularly to directly hear and learn from neighbors. Warren has also been both a leader and on staff with The People’s Lobby and People’s Action, where he has organized around issues including the Fair Tax, the Pre-Trial Fairness Act, and the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.
<br>
<br>
These experiences have informed Warren’s values, visions, and commitment to fight for affordable, accessible healthcare, housing, and public transit for the masses.

<br>
Warren is running for Alderman in Chicago’s 30th Ward to bring a people-first vision to the ward office and City Council. He believes the 30th Ward deserves leadership that prioritizes working class people and families, fosters true transparency, and fights for a more just, equitable ward where all can thrive. Warren will work towards universal access to public transportation, environmental justice and climate action, immigration rights, preventative public safety measures, affordable housing, and strong constituency services.
