As a member of the Black Abolitionist Network, Chicago DSA is campaigning to defund the Chicago Police Department (CPD) by 75% and reinvest these funds into healthcare, education, housing, and other essential public programs.

Policing and incarceration have become, as abolitionist scholar Ruth Wilson Gilmore states, “a catchall solution to social problems.” Instead of police, we need to fund our communities. By addressing the root causes of violence, we can meaningfully address harm and build towards a Chicago that provides prosperity and dignity for all.
