ComEd is Chicago’s electricity provider, and their contract with the city is up for renewal in 2020. For the first time in 30 years, we have a chance to take control of our energy future. By turning ComEd into a municipal utility controlled by the people of Chicago, for the people of Chicago, we can increase clean energy, get fairer rates, and put profits back into our community rather than into shareholders’ pockets.

## Get involved

Attend a campaign meeting to learn how you can help Democratize ComEd conduct research, work with local elected officials, and decarbonize our grid.
