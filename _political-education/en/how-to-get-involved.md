Thank you for your interest in getting involved with the work of Chicago DSA’s Political Education & Policy Committee – we’d love to have you join us! To succeed, socialism must be a mass movement that foregrounds radical inclusion and truly grassroots, bottom-up organizing. Whether you’re a veteran of the movement or new to socialism, we need every member of the working class on board.

For questions, comments, and concerns, please reach out to [public-facing email link]. To join CDSA, please check out our [recruitment page]. Here is a list of our [upcoming events].

To start, we suggest attending the next Socialist Night School! It’s a great way to learn a little bit about socialism while getting to know CDSA members. [Sign up here].
