This selection of readings has been put together by Chicago DSA’s Political Education and Policy Committee as a resource for CDSA members. This is by no means an exhaustive or definitive list, but we believe it provides a useful starting point for members interested in exploring the rich tradition of socialist political thought. Our philosophy of political education is that we do our best learning together, as comrades with a shared commitment to developing our collective analysis and building our movement. We encourage you to discuss what you’ve read — with friends, coworkers, comrades — and are committed to providing welcoming spaces for rigorous and comradely political discussion.

Check the CDSA Event Calendar and join us for a Socialist Night School, Red Square forum, or any one of our political education programs! All are welcome. Whether it’s your first DSA meeting or you’re an elected chapter leader, our space is richer for your participation in it. If you have questions or want to get involved with our political education team, reach out to [public-facing PEP email].
