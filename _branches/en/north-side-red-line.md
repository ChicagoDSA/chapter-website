title: North Side Red Line Branch
---

## Mission
Create a democratic, welcoming space for Northside socialists to learn, organize and grow working class power. We want to be an avenue for social cohesion and escalated involvement in the organizing goals of CDSA. This branch covers some of the most traditionally progressive bases in Chicago, and itâ€™s our task to push those bases toward socialism.
