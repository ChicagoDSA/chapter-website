## Mission
There is no socialist movement if it is not a multi-racial movement. There is no socialist movement if it doesnâ€™t speak to those most oppressed by the systems we find ourselves in. The south side of Chicago has always been the site of intense racist capitalist oppression in the city, as well as some of the most liberating historical working class movements. The south side branch of CDSA seeks to honor that tradition by building the socialist movement in the communities hardest hit by capitalism. We consider it a priority to build this movement among the Black and brown communities of the south side. 

The branch operates along three primary fronts of class struggle: the community, the workplace, and the state. In the community, we aim to unite and protect ourselves as neighbors against the forces of gentrification, environmental racism, predatory development, and racist institutions, such as the police and ICE. In the workplace, we are pitted against the bosses, the corporations, and the administrations, united as workers wielding our mightiest power: our labor. In the state, we aim to elect class struggle candidates to fight for the working class and public institutions as champions in city hall, using elections as a means of connecting with our communities, expanding the expectations of the working class for what we deserve, and building the base of our socialist movement.

We engage in mutual aid work through South Side Mutual Aid Solidarity (MAS). The work of MAS is overtly political, and offers space for our class to organize itself and challenge the systems that govern us to utilize our collective wealth to meet these needs as is their responsibility. We embrace the pursuit and practice of abolition.
