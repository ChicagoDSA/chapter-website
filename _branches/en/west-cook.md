## Mission

The West Cook Branch advocates for democratic socialism on the Chicago’s West Side and Western Suburbs. This includes organizing or participating in local events that align with our values, lobbying elected officials on policy and working on local political campaigns. The Branch is also working to bridge gaps between the suburbs and disenfranchised communities of color.

## Get involved

Anyone interested in participating with the West Cook branch should attend one of our monthly branch meetings which are listed on the CDSA Calendar. You can also follow our [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/WCCDSA). General email inquiries can be sent to [westcook@chicagodsa.org](mailto:westcook@chicagodsa.org).
