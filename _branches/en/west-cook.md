## Mission

Our activities have included local electoral work, housing justice, mutual aid, Fair Tax, LaSalle Street Tax, and “Defund the Police” work.

## Get involved

We have monthly general branch membership meetings that we try to schedule on weekend afternoons (historically the second Sunday of the month from 1-3 PM) except when this conflicts with Chapter activities. We also have a Branch Facebook page and google group. The google group is dedicated to DSA related discussions between Branch members.

We encourage all Branch members to join our google group (west-cook-cdsa+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com).
