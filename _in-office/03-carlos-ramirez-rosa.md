Serving as Chicago's 35th Ward alderperson since May 2015, Carlos has led successful legislative efforts to win property tax relief for working class homeowners, paid sick leave for Chicago workers, equality for transgender people in public facilities, and accountability and transparency on municipal financial transactions. Working alongside grassroots community organizations, Carlos recently led successful efforts to pass historic legislation that ensures Chicago is a true sanctuary city and enacts one of the nation's strongest civilian police oversight ordinances. Carlos has promoted inclusion and transparency in all his aldermanic work - the community-driven zoning process he has implemented in the 35th Ward has been recognized by local and national organizations as a model for community empowerment and transformation.
