Daniel La Spata has called Chicago home for the last 22 years, where he spent many of those years as a leader in the housing and community development space in the greater Logan Square area. He was inspired to run for Alderman after witnessing persistent anti-democratic and inequitable development processes, which left too many residents out of the prosperity of the City's booming economy and housing market.

Alderman La Spata was elected to represent Chicago's 1st Ward in 2019, where he has used his leadership and organizing experience to fight for policies that work toward creating a more equitable and sustainable Chicago. Alderman La Spata remains committed to helping Chicago break down its segregated past (and present), and weathering the storms of climate change through smart policy investments, and continued dialog and partnerships with neighbors, community organizations, and stakeholders. Danielâ€™s mission as alderman is to create a ward where every resident has the resources and opportunities to thrive. His office is committed to elevating marginalized voices, and collaborating with all interested stakeholders to build a community grounded in diversity, democracy and equity.
