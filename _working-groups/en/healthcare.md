The Healthcare Working Group believes that quality healthcare is a fundamental human right, not something only the rich should have access to. Therefore, we have resolved ourselves to do all we can to transform our nation's health care system to make it more accessible and equitable for everyone.

Join a meeting to learn more about how you can support Chicago DSA's work to support a healthcare system that works for all of us.
