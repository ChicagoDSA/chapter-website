The Communications Committee handles a broad range of projects and responsibilities that keep our chapter running smoothly. We run the various Chicago DSA social media pages and websites. We have a video team to support live-streaming and documentation of various chapter campaigns and events. Within the committee is a team that produces Midwest Socialist, a magazine and podcast covering a broad range of topics from a socialist perspective.

## Get involved
