The Socialist Feminist Working Group (SocFem) aims to bring a socialist feminist perspective to Chicago DSA and to the Chicago community. We give focus and priority to female-identifying and non-binary members of the Chicago community who face hardships under capitalism.

We work both within Chicago DSA and in the community to address the ways that capitalism oppresses some groups in different ways than others. Our work includes initiatives like fundraising for the Chicago Abortion Fund, exposing crisis pregnancy centers, and hosting educational events and reading groups about socialist feminism.

Join a meeting to learn more about how you can get involved.
